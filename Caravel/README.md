### Caravel Type P (Passenger)

| Crew           | Passengers               | Cargo | Low Berths | Notes                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | ----- | ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 3–6 (see note) | 24 (4 single, 20 double) | 20t   | 0          | 2 Stewards, Medic (often cross-trained) |

The Caravel Type P is a dedicated passenger liner, designed for comfortable interstellar travel between worlds. Its spacious interior is configured to accommodate up to 24 passengers: 4 in luxurious single-occupancy staterooms and 20 in well-appointed double-occupancy cabins. The ship is favored by small corporations, planetary governments, and independent operators running scheduled passenger services or chartered tours.

The standard crew consists of a Pilot, Astrogator, Engineer, two Stewards, and a Medic. However, in practice, roles are often combined—one crew member may serve as both Pilot and Astrogator, while another with medical training can double as a Steward, reducing operational costs. The Stewards are responsible for passenger comfort, meal service, and entertainment, ensuring a pleasant journey. The Medic (or cross-trained Steward) handles routine health checks and minor emergencies.

The Type P is known for its reliability, smooth ride, and attention to passenger needs, making it a common sight on established trade routes and in systems with a steady flow of travelers.

### Caravel Type C (Cargo)

| Crew           | Passengers | Cargo   | Low Berths | Notes                                 |
|----------------|------------|---------|------------|---------------------------------------|
| 2–4 (see note) | 0          | ~100t+  | 0          | Often run by 2 (Pilot/Astrogator, Engineer/Gunner) |

The Caravel Type C is a no-nonsense freighter, optimized for maximum cargo capacity. Every available cubic meter is dedicated to freight, with reinforced decks and cargo bays allowing for rapid loading and unloading. This variant is a favorite among independent traders, megacorporate subsidiaries, and frontier merchants who need to move goods efficiently between worlds.

The listed crew includes a Pilot, Astrogator, Engineer, and Gunner, but the ship is often run by just two people: a Pilot/Astrogator and an Engineer/Gunner, thanks to automation and streamlined controls. This minimal crew configuration maximizes profit margins, though it can be demanding during emergencies or pirate encounters.

The Type C is rugged and dependable, able to handle bulk goods, perishables, or even hazardous materials with minor modifications. Its reputation for reliability and low operating costs makes it a staple of the interstellar shipping lanes.

The Caravel Type G is the most versatile of the class, designed to handle a mix of cargo and passengers. With 40 tons of cargo space and accommodations for 12 passengers, it is ideal for small colony support, VIP transport, or mixed freight and passenger runs to outlying systems.

The crew typically consists of a Pilot, Astrogator, Engineer, Steward, and Gunner, allowing for flexible operations. The Steward manages passenger needs and assists with cargo logistics, while the Gunner provides security against piracy or hostile encounters.

Type G ships are often used by planetary governments, research teams, or adventuring groups who need a ship that can adapt to a variety of missions. Its modular interior can be reconfigured for special assignments, such as scientific expeditions, diplomatic envoys, or even small-scale rescue operations.

The Caravel Type M is a specialized variant, serving as a mobile hospital or aid ship. It is frequently deployed to disaster zones, war-torn regions, or remote worlds lacking adequate medical facilities. The ship can operate as a fully functional hospital in space or be converted into a field hospital when landed, with modular medical bays and support equipment.

The standard crew includes a Pilot, Astrogator, and Engineer, supported by a staff of 8 medical professionals—doctors, nurses, and medtechs.
