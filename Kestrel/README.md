## Overview

The **Kestrel-class** is the Imperial Scout Service’s most widely-deployed light craft, used for missions requiring stealth, autonomy, and speed. Designed for operation by a single Scout or a minimal two-person team, it is capable of operating independently for months at a time in the Outer Marches or uncharted sectors. All Kestrels are equipped with encrypted IFF beacons and jump-capable transponders to identify them as Imperial property.
