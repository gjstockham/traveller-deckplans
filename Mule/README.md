## 🐴 **Mule-class Trader (200 tons)**

_“It’s ugly, but it moves cargo.” The backbone of small-scale interstellar commerce._

**Overview:**  
The **Mule-class** is a common sight throughout Imperial space: a stubby, boxy hull with side-mounted cargo clamps and a reinforced undercarriage for rough surface landings. Designed with simplicity and adaptability in mind, the Mule can be operated by a crew of 2–4 and easily serviced even at frontier outposts. While underpowered and minimally armed, its reliability and modularity make it a favorite for long-haul merchants and regional supply contracts.

As standard, the Bridge module contains 2 single and 2 double occupancy staterooms
